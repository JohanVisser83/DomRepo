The workshop aims to bridge the gap by equipping South African entrepreneurs with practical tools and knowledge needed to compete on the global stage in the fields of digital innovation and entrepreneurship, ensuring that the knowledge gained is immediately applicable.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the true value lies in the hands-on, practical learning experience that empowers individuals to evolve into true innovators.\r\n\r\nWhile networking has its merits, our workshop's vision propels us beyond the traditional confines. Rather than merely facilitating connections, our aim is to guide participants on a profound journey of discovery and creation. The shift is undeniable; we are transitioning from a networking event to an immersive and mind-blowing practical workshop.\r\n\r\nThe world today beckons for more than just connections; it beckons for problem-solvers, creative thinkers, and digital innovators. We acknowledge that knowledge is most potent when applied. Our change in focus is propelled by a compelling desire to equip individuals with the skills and tools essential to drive tangible change in their organisations and industries.

As my health declined, I faced not only physical limitations but also the weight of past traumas. I realized the mindset I had been holding onto was no longer serving me.\r\n\r\nDetermined to transform my life, I turned to mindfulness. I started with simple practices like meditation, breathwork, journaling, and combining mindfulness with art. These practices helped me stay grounded in the present moment, cultivate awareness, and connect deeply with my thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nAs I delved deeper into mindfulness, I began to acknowledge my past without letting it control my present. Gradually, I developed a more compassionate relationship with myself, which improved my mental and physical well-being.\r\n\r\nMindfulness has empowered me to face challenges with resilience. I now embrace each moment as an opportunity for growth and healing. After years of ignoring my issues, I chose to confront and release these burdens because I knew I deserved better. I wanted more for my life, so I let go of what was holding me back.\r\n\r\nI immersed myself in the study of mindfulness and became a Mindfulness Master Practitioner. This practice transformed me into a calmer person who made peace with my past. While mindfulness isn’t a cure-all, it provides clarity and helps us view our lives more objectively. I firmly believe that self-talk and embracing our true, authentic selves are crucial to becoming better versions of ourselves. I didn’t start this to be a coach; I started this for me because I deserved better—and so do you!  I also believe in helping children to have a stronger mindset so that when they grow up they will be better prepared for our sometimes harsh surroundings.\r\n\r\nFor those new to mindfulness, deliberately paying attention in the moment might seem cold and clinical. However, mindfulness is anything but clinical. It is a rich, warm, life-enhancing practice. Though often difficult and painful, it is immensely rewarding.\r\n\r\nDuring my journey, I underwent numerous surgeries, experienced early menopause, and was diagnosed with several conditions, including:\r\n\r\n- Fibromyalgia\r\n\r\n- Complex Regional Pain Syndrome\r\n\r\n- Erythromelalgia\r\n\r\n- Underactive Thyroid\r\n\r\n- Extreme Allergies\r\n\r\n- Aneurysm\r\n\r\n- Vitamin D deficiency\r\n\r\nMy mission is to help one mindset at a time and to help you evolve with self.","workingHours":null,"youtube":null,"linkedIn":null,"tikTok":null,"instagram":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"coverimage":"https://discover.circularapp.io/Uploads\\Be_the_change_you_wish_to_see_in_the_world._Youtube_Banner_4714_202408090459.png","title":null,"titleName":null,"currencyToken":"ZAR","attendanceScan":false,"driverScan":false,"ticketScan":false,"isPaymentRestricted":true,"dashboardBanner":"https://discover.circularapp.io/Uploads\\Be_the_change_you_wish_to_see_in_the_world._Youtube_Banner_4714_202408090459.png","isExternalLink":false,"memberCount":"2

What became clear was these obstacles were extensive and stretched far beyond their group. Their gatherings soon spurred a local startup movement that attracted founders and experts from every industry, all coming together to share their advice and inspirations for early entrepreneurs. Eventually, vibrant Startup Grind communities (“chapters”) began developing in Los Angeles, Tel Aviv, London, New York, Beijing, and many more.\r\nOur community proves that entrepreneurs are in fact, stronger together.\r\n\r\nOur mission\r\nTo give startups everywhere the education and opportunities they need to build, grow, and scale their companies.\r\nWe strive to help founders, entrepreneurs, and startups succeed, regardless of geographic location or socioeconomic circumstance. We believe a better tomorrow is possible by supporting the innovators and risk-takers of today. 50% of our team are founders themselves, so we know from experience how difficult it can be. It cannot be done alone, and the COVID-19 pandemic has created an even greater sense of urgency. This is why we built a safe haven for emerging startups that share our belief that a better future is on the horizon — because we know it’s up to us to make it happen.\r\n\r\nOur values\r\nWe believe in making friends, not contacts. We believe in giving first, not taking. We believe in helping others before helping yourself.\r\nWe are passionate about the forces that strengthen our community and our chapters worldwide. We believe our investment in community-building is what drives our startups toward continued success. Each of us lives and breathes our values and relentlessly strives to do better everyday. What makes us different is our commitment to global citizenship, and our goal to lead by example in this space.

In the face of unrest in July 2021, a group of compassionate women from the Umhlanga area came together to cook and provide meals for the CPF members and those in need in the neighbouring regions.\r\n\r\nThese women, who had lived in the same neighbourhood for decades without crossing paths, found a common purpose in aiding, serving, and protecting their families.

Here at RBCS we strive to instill three values which we believe are clearly evident in scripture. First is “LOVE”. We exist, because of love. We have a future because of love. We have purpose, because of love. “We love because He first loved us” And so we strive to educate, encourage, discipline and grow from a place of love. We express this best in our worshiping God as creator, through loving as Christ loves us and sacrificed himself for us.  \r\n\r\nExcellence as a value speaks to the zeal with which we not only start each task, but even more so about how we finish each task. And so we strive for excellence in all that we do, whether it be education, sport, creative arts, or just our daily routine and self management. We believe that every student has greatness in them and we aspire to cultivate that in each individual through hard work and dedication, always striving to give it their best.\r\n\r\nAlexander the great once said; “I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion”. With Christ as the head and the Church as the body, we are an army of sheep led by a lion. As such we strive to grow leaders of character and virtue, who are willing to serve, sacrifice and lead with with boldness and courage.","workingHours":null,"youtube":null,"linkedIn":null,"tikTok":null,"instagram":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"coverimage":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Uploads\\RBCS_fda4_202407040909.png","title":null,"titleName":null,"currencyToken":"ZAR","attendanceScan":false,"driverScan":false,"ticketScan":false,"isPaymentRestricted":true,"dashboardBanner":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Uploads\\RBCS_fda4_202407040909.png","isExternalLink":false,"memberCount":"938 Members","postCount":100,"subscriptionType":null,"accessType":"Access code","coummunityUrl":"RichardsBayChristianSchool","price":0.00,"sponsorInformation":{"sponsorId":null,"communityId":null,"title":null,"sponsorLogo":null,"coverImage":null,"sponsorDecription":null,"emailButton":null,"callButton":null,"website":null,"businessAddress":null,"logoOnly":null,"sectionDetails":[]},"communitySettings":[],"publicType":"Private","joinButton":"Enter Access Code","communityAddress":"70 Disa Dives Veldenvlei, Richards Bay","id":107,"orgLogo":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Uploads\\RBCS_1_5832_202407043014.png","membershipType":"Free","membershipTypeId":101,"isPeerTransferRestricted":true,"ownerCustomerId":0,"externalLink":[],"paymentgateways":[],"isMyCommunity":0,"paymentGatewayReturnURL":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Payment/PaymentStatus?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}"},{"customerId":0,"communityId":1,"communityName":"BizBrolly","communityCode":"10501","communityLogo":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Uploads\\BizBrolly_logo_white_77fc_202407042354.jpg","isPrimary":false,"website":"https://www.BizBrolly.com","primaryEmail":"ambika.rahangdale007@gmail.com","primaryContact":"8077466613","primaryMobileNo":"+919718511462","currencyCode":"R","completeAddress":null,"about":"BizBrolly Solutions is a technology driven innovation lab building the platforms, products and services that enable awesome internet business.

In the face of unrest in July 2021, a group of compassionate women from the Umhlanga area came together to cook and provide meals for the CPF members and those in need in the neighbouring regions.\r\n\r\nThese women, who had lived in the same neighbourhood for decades without crossing paths, found a common purpose in aiding, serving, and protecting their families. Through this shared mission, they forged a strong bond that transcended cultural, racial, religious, and belief barriers, uniting an inclusive community.\r\n\r\nAs they initiated deliveries of grocery hampers, food, and essential supplies to the less fortunate, they witnessed the profound impact of COVID-19 and the unrest on the vulnerable population. It was this revelation that prompted them to formalize the organization and commit to making a positive difference in people’s lives on a daily basis.

to bring together young innovators and startup entrepreneurs who are passionate about making a difference. In a world where big business interests often overshadow the voices of emerging talent, The Founder Chronicles stands as a beacon for those who strive to create meaningful change. We believe that every young entrepreneur deserves to be heard, and we are committed to being their voice and support system.\r\n\r\nOur Circular platform is dedicated to celebrating the power of community and the incredible potential of collaboration. We host monthly get-togethers where like-minded businesses can mingle, share ideas, and build relationships—free from the pressures of corporate agendas. These gatherings are not just networking events; they are spaces where the spirit of innovation thrives, and where the next generation of leaders can find their tribe.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our monthly events, we organise quarterly pitch sessions that give key startups in our community the opportunity to showcase their ideas. These events are designed to offer more than just a stage; they provide a supportive environment where young entrepreneurs can seek guidance, mentorship, and the resources they need to turn their visions into reality. We connect them with an expansive network of mentors, investors, and peers who are equally committed to driving socio-economic change.\r\n\r\nAt The Founder Chronicles, we recognise the immense potential of the millions of young entrepreneurs who are shaping the future. Our mission is to uplift these voices, providing them with the platform and the support they need to succeed. We are not just about business—we are about building a movement where every innovator can thrive, and where the collective power of our community can drive real, lasting
