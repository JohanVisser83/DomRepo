In the face of unrest in July 2021, a group of compassionate women from the Umhlanga area came together to cook and provide meals for the CPF members and those in need in the neighbouring regions.\r\n\r\nThese women, who had lived in the same neighbourhood for decades without crossing paths, found a common purpose in aiding, serving, and protecting their families. Through this shared mission, they forged a strong bond that transcended cultural, racial, religious, and belief barriers, uniting an inclusive community.\r\n\r\nAs they initiated deliveries of grocery hampers, food, and essential supplies to the less fortunate, they witnessed the profound impact of COVID-19 and the unrest on the vulnerable population. It was this revelation that prompted them to formalize the organization and commit to making a positive difference in people’s lives on a daily basis.

Here at RBCS we strive to instill three values which we believe are clearly evident in scripture. First is “LOVE”. We exist, because of love. We have a future because of love. We have purpose, because of love. “We love because He first loved us” And so we strive to educate, encourage, discipline and grow from a place of love. We express this best in our worshiping God as creator, through loving as Christ loves us and sacrificed himself for us.  \r\n\r\nExcellence as a value speaks to the zeal with which we not only start each task, but even more so about how we finish each task. And so we strive for excellence in all that we do, whether it be education, sport, creative arts, or just our daily routine and self management. We believe that every student has greatness in them and we aspire to cultivate that in each individual through hard work and dedication, always striving to give it their best.\r\n\r\nAlexander the great once said; “I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion”. With Christ as the head and the Church as the body, we are an army of sheep led by a lion. As such we strive to grow leaders of character and virtue, who are willing to serve, sacrifice and lead with with boldness and courage.","workingHours":"07h30 - 14h30","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQZxxkkaeENbSvKL9dHs9kg","linkedIn":"","tikTok":"","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/richards_bay_christian_school/?hl=en","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/rbcsupdate/","twitter":"","coverimage":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Uploads\\Banner_Template_1_8d8a_202404293325.png","title":"Mrs. Bev Chambler","titleName":"Principal","dashboardBanner":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Uploads\\RBCS_fda4_202407040909.png","membershipType":null,"membershipTypeId":0,"subscriptionTierId":0,"accessTypeId":0,"isExternalLink":false,"memberCount":null,"postCount":null,"subscriptionType":null,"accessType":null,"coummunityUrl":null,"price":null,"sponsorInformation":{"sponsorId":null,"communityId":null,"title":null,"sponsorLogo":null,"coverImage":null,"sponsorDecription":null,"emailButton":null,"callButton":null,"website":null,"businessAddress":null,"logoOnly":null,"sectionDetails":[],"id":0,"guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","isActive":false,"createdDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","createdBy":0,"modifiedBy":0,"createdDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"communitySettings":[{"communityId":1,"key":"Service_Fee","value":"5","description":"Service Fee","currencyCode":"ZAR","fixedValue":2.00,"id":111,"guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","isActive":false,"createdDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","createdBy":0,"modifiedBy":0,"createdDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"communityId":1,"key":"Withdrawl_Fee","value":"4","description":"Withdrawal Fee","currencyCode":"ZAR","fixedValue":5.00,"id":112,"guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","isActive":false,"createdDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","createdBy":0,"modifiedBy":0,"createdDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"communityId":1,"key":"Minimum_Withdrawal","value":"100","description":"Minimum Withdrawal","currencyCode":"ZAR","fixedValue":0.00,"id":113,"guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","isActive":false,"createdDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","createdBy":0,"modifiedBy":0,"createdDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"}],"paymentgateways":[{"communityId":107,"gatewayName":"Stripe","apiKey":null,"secretKey":null,"callBackUrl":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Payment/PaymentStatus","successUrl":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Payment/PaymentStatus?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}","failureUrl":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Payment/PaymentStatus?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}","pendingUrl":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Payment/PaymentStatus","id":196727,"guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","isActive":false,"createdDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","createdBy":0,"modifiedBy":0,"createdDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"}],"currencyToken":"ZAR","attendanceScan":false,"driverScan":false,"ticketScan":false,"isPaymentRestricted":false,"isPeerTransferRestricted":true,"ownerCustomerId":213,"externalLink":[],"publicType":null,"joinButton":null,"communityAddress":null,"id":2119,"orgLogo":null,"isMyCommunity":0,"discoveryBaseURL":null,"paymentGatewayReturnURL":"","guid":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","isActive":false,"createdDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","createdBy":0,"modifiedBy":0,"createdDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","modifiedDateOnly":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"customerId":1786,"communityId":150,"communityName":"Bergvliet High School","communityLogo":"https://connect.circular.ooo/Uploads\\BergVliet_logo_f038_202407042554.png","communityCode":"83771","isPrimary":false,"website":"https://bhs.org.za/","primaryEmail":"info@bhs.org.za","primaryContact":"+27842062094","primaryMobileNo":"0217120284","currencyCode":"R","completeAddress":"Firgrove Way, Bergvliet, Cape Town, 7806,South Africa","about":"Bergvliet High School is a co-educational high school in the heart of the Constantia Valley where more than 1,000 learners, across the spectrum of South African society, study a wide range of academic subjects.

In a world where big business interests often overshadow the voices of emerging talent, The Founder Chronicles stands as a beacon for those who strive to create meaningful change. We believe that every young entrepreneur deserves to be heard, and we are committed to being their voice and support system.\r\n\r\nOur Circular platform is dedicated to celebrating the power of community and the incredible potential of collaboration. We host monthly get-togethers where like-minded businesses can mingle, share ideas, and build relationships—free from the pressures of corporate agendas. These gatherings are not just networking events; they are spaces where the spirit of innovation thrives, and where the next generation of leaders can find their tribe.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our monthly events, we organise quarterly pitch sessions that give key startups in our community the opportunity to showcase their ideas. These events are designed to offer more than just a stage; they provide a supportive environment where young entrepreneurs can seek guidance, mentorship, and the resources they need to turn their visions into reality. We connect them with an expansive network of mentors, investors, and peers who are equally committed to driving socio-economic change.\r\n\r\nAt The Founder Chronicles, we recognise the immense potential of the millions of young entrepreneurs who are shaping the future. Our mission is to uplift these voices, providing them with the platform and the support they need to succeed. We are not just about business—we are about building a movement where every innovator can thrive, and where the collective power of our community can drive real, lasting change.","workingHours":"Always
